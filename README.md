👋 Hi there! I’m Eugenh, a night owl with a System Engineering background and a daytime explorer of both nature and new knowledge.
My journey into web development started with the magic of transforming an educational blog template with just a line of HTML.
Seeing my ideas come to life through code was addictive.

💻 I’m currently navigating the Web Development and AI landscape with Le Wagon’s bootcamp, eager to refine my skills and unlock new ways to innovate.

🚀 My big dream? Launching a startup that creates web apps to streamline business processes.
I’m especially passionate about developing educational apps that simplify learning and progress tracking—imagine a lively platform where teachers can share and sell resources!

🌿 Before diving into coding, I was dedicated to teaching English through a blog and Instagram, blending creativity with instruction.
Coding felt like the perfect next step to continue solving problems and crafting impactful solutions.

💡 Here’s a bit of humor to brighten your day:
Developer 1: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode?"
Developer 2: "Because light attracts bugs!" 🐛

📂 Dive into my projects and see what I’m up to—always learning, always coding!
